# PhD Tools
A number of tools and scripts that were initially made for my PhD work. 

## **SAPS** - **S**imulation **A**nalysis and **P**reparation **S**uite
**NOW MOVED TO IT'S OWN REPO:** [MD-SAPS](https://github.com/ravenswing/mdsaps)

## Old Python Scripts
* metaMon:  Monitor and analyse remote metadynamics simulations. 
* histidineSeq: Make Hydrophilic Block .pdb structure files from sequence. 
* arrangePdbs: Construct a "brush" of peptides from an input pdb.
* runReweight: Perform re-weighting on UCB metadynamics data.
