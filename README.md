# PhD Tools
A number of tools and scripts that were initially made for my PhD work. 

## **SAPS** -  Simulation Analysis and Preparation Suite
**S**imulation **A**nalysis and **P**reparation **S**uite for molecular dynamics and metadynamics.
**NOW MOVED TO IT'S OWN REPO:** [MD-SAPS](https://github.com/ravenswing/mdsaps)

## Python Scripts
* metaMon:  Monitor and analyse remote metadynamics simulations. 
* histidineSeq: Make Hydrophilic Block .pdb structure files from sequence. 
* arrangePdbs: Construct a "brush" of peptides from an input pdb.
* runReweight: Perform re-weighting on UCB metadynamics data. 

## PyMOL Scripts
* Funnel drawing for various projects.
* Building sequences -> see brush building and beta-sheet maker.
* Center of Mass (external)
* PyMOL tips

## Simulation Files
* HPC Benchmarking: Scripts and files for benchmarking high performance computing clusters. 
* Forcefields: Ports of Amber forcefields for use with Gromacs. 
* Submission Scripts: Standard submission scripts for HPC clusters, and for local system preparation.
 
## Bash Scripts
