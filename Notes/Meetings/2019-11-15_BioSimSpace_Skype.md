### Friday 15th November 2019

## Participants
FLG
Dom
Lester Hedges - BSS
Sarah Feegan - STFC
Toni Mey - post doc with Julien Michel

## Our Feedback 
Suggestions:
* adding metaD support for more than just Gromacs
* adding error analysis to make metaD more usable for novices
* adding to clusters like Archer?
* inclusion of more CVs would be good - Plumed Nest to decide priorities

Positives:
* were able to run Funnel-metaD start-to-finish with only BSS
* live monitoring is unique feature and very useful for teaching
* no errors or major issues with usage

## Take away messages / conclusions
1. Looks like development is majorly slowing down as Lester is leaving
2. Sarah appears to be taking over, but seems to know little
3. **I said I would help Toni with Tutorial Paper**

   I have emailed her to let her know my intension to help.
